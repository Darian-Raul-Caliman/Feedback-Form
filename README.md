This minimal feedback form is designed for quick and accessible user input. It consists of only three fields:

Name: The user's name (optional or required depending on preference).

Email: For follow-up or verification (optional or required).

Feedback: An open-ended text box for users to write their thoughts, comments, or suggestions.

The simplicity encourages higher response rates and lowers the barrier for users to share honest feedback
